				Yet another RF outlet controller, where it is controlled from a Raspberry Pi, and the client is a simple GUI.The idea 
				is essentially make it as simple as possible, but still have useful functionality that could easily be used in home 
				automation or just used standalone for DIYers.It should be noted that this project is used in conjunction with 433MHz 
				RF modules, it could probably work with 315MHz RF Modules, but that has not been tested currently.
